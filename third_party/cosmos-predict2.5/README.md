NVIDIA Cosmos™ is a platform purpose-built for physical AI, featuring state-of-the-art generative world foundation models (WFMs), robust guardrails, and an accelerated data processing and curation pipeline. Designed specifically for real-world systems, Cosmos enables developers to rapidly advance physical AI applications such as autonomous vehicles (AVs), robots, and video analytics AI agents.

Cosmos World Foundation Models come in three model types which can all be customized in post-training: [cosmos-predict](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5), [cosmos-transfer](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5), and [cosmos-reason](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1).

## Cosmos-Predict2.5

We introduce Cosmos-Predict2.5, the latest version of the Cosmos World Foundation Models (WFMs) family, specialized for simulating and predicting the future state of the world in the form of video. Cosmos-Predict2.5 is a flow based model that unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World into a single model and utilizes Cosmos-Reason1, a Physical AI reasoning vision language model (VLM), as the text encoder. Cosmos-Predict2.5 significantly improves upon Cosmos-Predict1 in both quality and prompt alignment.

### Image2World

<details><summary>Input prompt</summary>
A nighttime city bus terminal gradually shifts from stillness to subtle movement. At first, multiple double-decker buses are parked under the glow of overhead lights, with a central bus labeled '87D' facing forward and stationary. As the video progresses, the bus in the middle moves ahead slowly, its headlights brightening the surrounding area and casting reflections onto adjacent vehicles. The motion creates space in the lineup, signaling activity within the otherwise quiet station. It then comes to a smooth stop, resuming its position in line. Overhead signage in Chinese characters remains illuminated, enhancing the vibrant, urban night scene.

### Video2World

<details><summary>Input prompt</summary>
A robotic arm, primarily white with black joints and cables, is shown in a clean, modern indoor setting with a white tabletop. The arm, equipped with a gripper holding a small, light green pitcher, is positioned above a clear glass containing a reddish-brown liquid and a spoon. The robotic arm is in the process of pouring a transparent liquid into the glass. To the left of the pitcher, there is an opened jar with a similar reddish-brown substance visible through its transparent body. In the background, a vase with white flowers and a brown couch are partially visible, adding to the contemporary ambiance. The lighting is bright, casting soft shadows on the table. The robotic arm's movements are smooth and controlled, demonstrating precision in its task. As the video progresses, the robotic arm completes the pour, leaving the glass half-filled with the reddish-brown liquid. The jar remains untouched throughout the sequence, and the spoon inside the glass remains stationary. The other robotic arm on the right side also stays stationary throughout the video. The final frame captures the robotic arm with the pitcher finishing the pour, with the glass now filled to a higher level, while the pitcher is slightly tilted but still held securely by the gripper.
